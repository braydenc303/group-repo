# group-repo

experiments in conflict

## Todos

1. I will create the repo.

2. I will add Mike as a collaborator

3. I will set protection rules.

4. I will create a branch called initial, create the html file template with nothing in the body and push that up. Then create the pull request for Mike to merge it in.

5. After he merges my branch in, Mike will pull that down and create a branch called "paragraphs" add the two paragraphs and push up his branch.

6. While he is making his changes, I will make some changes of my own on a branch called "heading", and add and commit them.

7. Mike will then do a git pull origin master to be safe.

8. Followed by a git add, git commit, and git push to his branch that he will then create a pull request for.

9. I will merge his changes in.

10. I will then go back to my branch and git pull origin master to be safe. This is where we should see a conflict to be resolved.

11. I will then resolve the conflict, save the file, and add, commit, and push the changes in my branch.

12. I can then create a pull request

13. Mike will merge that in

14. We can then both pull into our local master branches, create new branches, and delete old branches.
